11.	Numb 3 = Numb1 * Numb2
12.	Print “The Numb 3 is ”
13.	End



D. Check whether a given number is positive, negative,     or zero.


1.	Start 
2.	Input Numb 1 
3.	If numb1>0
4.	Print “The Number is positive”

E. Determine if a person is a teenager (between 13   and    19 years old)


1.	Start 
2.	Input Age 
3.	If age>13 and age<19
4.	Print “The person is teenager”
5.	Else 
6.	Print “The person is not a teenager”
7.	End 




                                                                     ALGORITHM

A.  Implement an algorithm to determine if a given year is   a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, except if it is also divisible by 400.

1.	Ask the user to enter year 
2.	Read the condition 
3.	Condition: year%4=0 and year%100≠0 or year%400=0
4.	Print  “It is the leap year” 
5.	Else 
6.	Print “It is not a leap year”

B. Implement an algorithm to count the number of   occurrence of each character in a given  string.

1.	Ask the user to enter the alphabet of string
2.	Store in variable occurrence 
3.	Built-in-function: occurrence= string. count(alphabet)
4.	 Print the occurrence 
5.	 Repeat the same occurrence for every step

C. Write an algorithm to calculate x raised to the  power y (i.e., x y ) without using built-in
power functions.

1.	Ask user to input Number X and power y 
2.	Run For Loop from 1 till Y 
3.	Inside the loop, Run the program Result=Result*X
4.	Print the value of X outside the loop 


D.	Calculate the area of a circle given its radius r

1.	Radius r 
2.	 Set Area to (3.14*r*r)
3.	Display Area for the user


E.	Find the median of three given numbers.

1.	 Initialize three numbers as X1, X2, X3
2.	If X2>X1 and  X2<X3 then X2 is the median 
3.	 If X1>X2 and X1<X3 then X1 is the median 
4.	 Else X3 is the median  
5.	Display Median
